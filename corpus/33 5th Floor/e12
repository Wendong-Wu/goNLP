We are buying some furniture etc and we will share it with you but you are renting space, not a furnished office like at MicroOffice.
Make sure you guys are prepared to get your own stuff if you don't like what we provide.
Our general plan of attack is have a bunch of "ok" tables and chairs.
Then we will spend August getting it up to super stylish beautifulness.
